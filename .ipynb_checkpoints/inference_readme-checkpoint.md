You can use this blueprint to  use a particular model to predict results for if a customer is likely to churn or not using your own customized dataset.
For using this pretrained churn-detection model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes.

1. Click on `Use Blueprint` button
2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can use the `Try it Live` section with a single row of data to check your model
5. You can also integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page

Congrats! You have deployed an API endpoint that detects about-to-churn customers amongst a larger customer pool!
