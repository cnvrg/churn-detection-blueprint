Use this blueprint to immediately predict results for whether a customer or client is likely to churn. To use this pretrained churn-detection model, create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be quickly integrated with your data and application.

This inference blueprint’s model was trained using telecom customer data. To use custom churn data according to your specific business, run this counterpart’s [training blueprint](https://metacloud.cloud.cnvrg.io/marketplace/blueprints/churn-detection-train), which trains the model and establishes an endpoint based on the newly trained model.

Complete the following steps to deploy this churn-detector endpoint:
1. Click the **Use Blueprint** button.
2. In the dialog, select the relevant compute to deploy the API endpoint and click the **Start** button.
3. The cnvrg software redirects to your endpoint. Complete one or both of the following options:
   - Use the Try it Live section with a relevant user ID to check the model’s prediction accuracy.
   - Use the bottom integration panel to integrate your API with your code by copying in your code snippet.

An API endpoint that detects about-to-churn customers among a larger customer pool has now been deployed.
